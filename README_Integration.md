# Megatron-LM + Lossy Network Integration

## Quick Start

1. **Test your existing setup:**
   ```bash
   python test_integration.py
   ```

2. **Install Megatron-LM (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python setup_megatron_simple.py install
   ```

3. **Run experiments:**
   ```bash
   # Test Megatron availability
   bash run_experiments_megatron.sh test-megatron
   
   # Run full experiments
   bash run_experiments_megatron.sh run
   
   # Analyze results
   bash run_experiments_megatron.sh analyze
   ```

## Files

- `pytorch_train_tp_gpt_megatron.py` - Main training script with Megatron integration
- `run_experiments_megatron.sh` - Experimental script for batch runs
- `test_integration.py` - Quick test to verify everything works
- `setup_megatron_simple.py` - This setup script

## What This Does

This integration gives you:

✅ **Production-scale tensor parallelism** from Megatron-LM  
✅ **Your existing lossy network research** preserved  
✅ **Your existing experimental setup** maintained  
✅ **Fallback to custom TP** if Megatron is not available  
✅ **Direct comparison** between implementations  

## Research Benefits

- Test lossy communication on larger models that require tensor parallelism
- Compare optimized vs custom tensor parallel implementations
- Study loss effects at production scale
- Maintain all your existing experimental configurations

Your research setup remains exactly the same - just with better performance and scalability!
